Business Intelligence Analyst & Strategist
------------------------------------------

I am a self taught programmer with two certifications via Cousera pertaining to Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. In addition to the certifications, I believe myself to be a forever learner, therefore, I am committed to developing my skills further in Python and SQL via personal projects and specialization courses with hands on experience. This is where you can learn a little about me as a potential colleague and I look forward to showcasing my skillset via projects I have done. Enjoy!!!
